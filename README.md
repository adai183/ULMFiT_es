# ULMFit ES
This repository contains implementations of [ULMFit](https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.06146) by Jeremy Howard and Sebastian Ruder applied to NLP tasks for the Spanish Language.

Francisco Ingham [project](https://github.com/fpingham/SpanishULMFit)  for *Classification of Spanish Tweets as of 2017 in the GeneralTASS Dataset* was used as a starting point for hyperparameter tuning.

A F1(macro) score of  0.7308 is achieved(see [notebook](https://github.com/adai183/ULMFiT_es/blob/master/Evaluation%20and%20Interpretation.ipynb)). The fine-tuning and training of the classifier should not take longer than a couple of minutes on a machine suitable for deep-learning with a very basic GPU.

```
git clone https://github.com/adai183/ULMFiT_es.git
